# 5-Stages-Pipeline-MIPS-CPU-Based-on-Logism-FPGA
1縲・mployed system engineering methods to build a single-cycle CPU that can operate 28 MIPS instructions on logisim


2縲．esigned the CPU instruction register module with verilog based upon the vivado platform, integrated modules from other team members, and checked the functions of each 


3縲！mplemented the ideal pipeline CPU circuit, branch related pipeline CPU circuit, bubble pipeline CPU circuit, redirected pipeline CPU circuit and branch prediction CPU circuit meanwhile the single-period single-stage interrupt CPU circuit and the single-period multistage interrupt CPU circuit


4縲：inished the design of multilevel pipelining interrupt circuit
